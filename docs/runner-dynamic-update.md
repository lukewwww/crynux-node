# Runner Dynamic Update: What Actually Gets Updated

This document explains how the node's "Runner version" works and what is dynamically updated.

## 1) Where the final Runner version comes from

The final source of truth is the worker package version string:

- `crynux_worker.__version__` in the worker runtime files

Version flow is:

1. `crynux_worker_process.py` reads version from `crynux_worker.version()` (which returns `__version__`).
2. If patches are found, patch files are applied to local worker runtime files. These patches can update `crynux_worker/__init__.py`, including `__version__`.
3. After patch apply, `crynux_worker_process.py` restarts the inner worker process.
4. The restarted worker connects to server WebSocket `/manager/v1/worker/` and sends `{"version": "x.y.z"}` in the first message.
5. Server sets this value into in-memory `worker_manager.version`.
6. WebUI `GET /node/runner/version` reads `worker_manager.version` and displays it.

So the version is not persisted in node manager state. It is reported by the currently running worker process after restart.

## 2) What component performs dynamic update

Dynamic update is implemented by the worker process launcher:

- `crynux-worker/crynux_worker_process.py`

The node starts this process from `src/crynux_server/worker_manager/manager.py`, passing:

- `CRYNUX_WORKER_PATCH_URL` (from `task_config.worker_patch_url`)
- runtime directories and node/relay URLs

Default patch source (from `config/config.yml`) is:

- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crynux-ai/crynux-worker/main`

## 3) How update is performed at runtime

Inside `crynux_worker_process.py`, update loop is:

1. Read current worker version (`crynux_worker.__version__`).
2. Fetch `patches.txt`.
3. Keep only versions after current version.
4. Keep only patches with the same **major** version.
5. Fetch each patch file from `patches/<platform>/<version>.patch`.
6. Apply patch text to local files with `whatthepatch`.
7. If any patch is applied, terminate and restart the inner worker process.
8. Repeat every 60 seconds.

Important details:

- Cross-major updates are blocked by design (`major` must match).
- Patch apply is file-level diff patching, not package-manager install.
- After restart, worker reconnects and reports new version; WebUI then shows updated runner version.

## 4) Which files are actually updated

The updater patches files referenced by each `.patch` diff header path.

In other words, it updates files inside the worker runtime package area, not `src/crynux_server` node backend code.

Examples:

- Source mode patch path example:
  - `worker/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/crynux_worker/...`
  - `worker/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/gpt_task/...`
- Windows packaged patch path example:
  - `crynux_worker_process/_internal/crynux_worker/...`
  - `crynux_worker_process/_internal/gpt_task/...`

This shows that dynamic update can modify:

- worker framework code (`crynux_worker`)
- task implementation packages embedded in worker runtime (for example `gpt_task`)

It does **not** directly patch node server modules under `src/crynux_server`.
